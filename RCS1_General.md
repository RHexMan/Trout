### General

Most of the time trout feed opportunistically, biting at everything edible, and much that is inedible, that drifts by them.  Occasionally, however, they eat only selectively, sometimes in a frenzy of surface activity, on clouds of identical bugs.  Flyfishers call these events, inaccurately, "hatches".  They are very exciting, and would seem to provide an opportunity to catch fish after fish.  Sadly, most people come up short.  This is because, since the fish are so selective, you need to get a whole set of details specific to that particular feeding event just right, and since it often doesn't last very long, you need to figure out what to do very quickly.  That is only possible if you have advance knowledge.  The Emergence Charts are meant to be compendia that let you get ahead of the game, or at worst, play effective catch up.

Visible activity on the surface is actually only one of many forms of selective feeding of trout on aquatic insects, and arguably the least important.  The life stages of these insects, and the situations where they are available to be eaten by fish have been studied in detail and excellent articles and books at all levels of erudition may be found.  For mayflies, the current top-of-the-line book on fishing entomology is "Mayflies - An Angler's Study of Trout Water Ephemeroptera", M. Knopf and R. Cormier, Graycliff Publishing Company, Helena, Montana, 1997.  It is exhaustive, and at the same time, accessible and practical, with wonderfully clear illustrations. The earlier, "Selective Trout", D. Swisher and C. Richards, The Lyons Press, New York, 1971, deals with other trout food in addition to mayflies, is very good, but is not in the same league.  See "Mayflies, the Angler, and the Trout", Fred Arbona, Winchester Press, Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1980, for the idea of behavior by family. "Caddisflies", Gary LaFontaine, The Lyons Press, 1981, is, far and away, the best caddis fishing entomology book.  Note in particular the emphasis on precise life stages and water column location of availability.  The current definitive overview on the biology and classification of caddis larve is "Larvae of the North American Caddisfly Genera, 2nd Ed., G. B. Wiggins, U. of Toronto Press.  Of course, the more recent writers have built on the scientific and popular work that came before -- a huge cooperative effort going back centuries.

There is nothing original in the Emergence Charts beyond my understanding of Knopf and Cormier, and LaFountaine, in view of Arbona, stripped to the (fishing) bone.  In particular, they give no support for their assertions, and only minimal definitions.  You must go to the books for the meat.  The charts simply provide a graphic overview and an aide memoire.

The graphic part of each chart on the first page shows spatio-temporal information by family, as well as the critical fishing details in abreviated form.  There is a summary of ideas in the left hand column, as well as the list of abreviations.  The second page is a field-level identification key, yielding name, size, and adult (dun for mayflies) color description for confirmation.  Again organization is by family. Following each family key, there is general text that applies to the whole family.  Genera and species are keyed below the family, and more description and other information given.  The advantage of organization by key is that it lets you see clearly what features, behaviors, and fishing techniques can be lumped and which need to be separated.

I find that heavy use of abreviation and structured color coding is helpful in that by compacting the verbiage, it lets the key structure show through more clearly.  It doesn't take long to learn to read the color codes directly into words.  I have used single letters to signify colors that occur most commonly in nature, which tells you a little something extra.  Here is an example:  read "Cinygmula ramaleyi (7-8mm) RB/dkOB, W-dkG, T-G" as genus Cinygmula, species ramaleyi, typical dun size 7 to 8 mm (excluding tails and antennae), body color can range between reddish brown and dark olive brown, wings dark gray, tails gray.

The main way to use the charts is to pick up a bug and figure out what it is from its physical appearance and when and where you found it, using these three things to confirm one another. Once you believe you know what you've got, ruthlessly follow the fishing instructions using a fly of an appropriate pattern and the right size and color.  So, for example, don't fish duns when the nymph crawls out and ecloses on shore; don't fish spinners when they fall at night; if the float time is short, fish a wet or emerger rather than a parachute; don't use a surface egg-laying pattern if the bug oviposits by diving.
 
To work at this level, you really have to have the bugs in your hand.  To make the finest distinctions, unless you have very good eyes, you'll probably need to use a low-power hand loup.  However, one of the benefits of the chart format is that it lets you work back and forth, using what you know about location and timing to perhaps reduce the amount of detail you must observe on the bug.  For example, if you are in a fast mountain stream and you have a clinger in hand, you probably have a Rhithrogena or an Epeorus, not a Heptagenia.

Some notes on terminology:  The unfamiliar word "eclose" figures prominently in the chart.  As used here (following the insect biologists), it designates the escape of the (first) adult form from the final pre-adult skin (nymph for mayflies, pherate for caddis).  This is an event of large significance to feeding trout, and of supreme importance to fly flishers.  Knowing when and where (at the bottom of the stream, a foot below the surface, in the film, on land) this happens is critical to effective choice of pattern and fishing technique.

With eclose in hand, I can (and do) limit my use of the word "emergence" to its literal meaning of getting out of the water -- still quite an important concept.

I avoid the debased word "hatch" entirely.  As applied to aquatic insects, it should mean the nymph or larva getting out of the egg -- an occurrence that is never of interest to the fish or fisher.  That the same word is used as a synonym of emerge is unfortunate, but historical.  When it is extended to oviposition it becomes confounding, and to expiration, bizzare.

The data shown in the charts is the best I have been able to come up with.  I have tried to put in a question mark when I don't know what to believe.  Unfortunately, each author provides information as if it were true, but, of course, different authors say different things, or sometimes say things that are too much the same.

Some bugs inhabit, and emerge from, very specific water types, while others range more broadly.  In the graphical part of the charts, I have tried to place species adjacent to or between appropriate water type labels.  I have also tried make the descriptions concrete with examples of particular streams where the bug was actually reported found.  When possible I have given well-known California waters, but frequently out-of-state was the best I could find.  In any case, simply listing a name is unsatisfactory, because a given stream almost always contains more than one type of water.  To get the best idea, visualize a place on the named water having the described type.

Except for family descriptors, I have avoided common names.  I know this seems severe, but my goal was precision, and common names are frequently confusing (eg., important PMDs showing BWO coloring).  If the latin bothers, you can simply follow the lead of most professionals and shorten it to make a nickname (think "baetis", "trico", "paralept").  One of the things that makes us shy from taxonomic names is uncertainty about pronunciation.  Scholars (both scientific and linquistic) are themselves divided on this (classical latin died before Linnaeus, by his time, liturgical latin was already diverse, and now, almost no one uses latin except for science).  As far as I can determine, the modern concensus is that you should pronounce the names as you would in the language you are speaking.  Your audience will always understand what you are saying, and that is the whole point.  For example, say "rhinoceros".

Perhaps the most surprising thing revealed by the charts is how few specific flies we need to concern ourselves with -- ones that engender selective trout feeding opportunities that are both fishable and important.  This has a very useful consequence:  Since so few bugs need to be imitated, you can fit your mayfly artificials (with the exception of the two huge burrowers, which are typically targeted on special trips anyway) into a single box, which can be labeled internally to match the keyed bugs on page 2.  Similarly for caddis (where Dicosmoecus and Hesperophylax are the exceptions).  If you organize in this way, your fly boxes themselves provide colored, full-scale facsimiles of the naturals.
