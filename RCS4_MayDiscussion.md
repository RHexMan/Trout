### Mayflies

Two phenomena enhance the value of the mayfly chart and make it easy to understand and use:  1) Arbona's Principles, as stated in the left column of the chart, apply well to mayflies - genera in a given family all behave in very similar manners and share morphological features that are easy to observe in the field; 2) the short period during which a generation (or partial generation) of nymphs ripen, become active, eclose, mate, oviposit and die, works to highlight and bind these occurences.

As we shall see below, the caddisfly chart needs to be dealt with rather more carefully.

Crib:  All crawlers have 3 tails both as nymphs and adults; all swimmer adults have 2 tails -- in these families, a middle nymph tail is always lost during eclosion. Clinger nymphs look squashed and have eyes on top of the head, and Drunella make you think of crabs and the eyes point to the sides. In common usage, large mayflies are called "Drakes", small ones often "Quills" and others simply, but strangely "Duns".  Members of the family Baetidae (Baetids) are called "Blue-winged Olives" (BWOs) or "Baetis" except Callibaetis, which are called "Speckled Duns".  The Baetids with no hind wings tend to be even smaller than those with, and are sometimes called "Tiny BWOs".  The most important Ephemerellas (infrequens, inermis) are called "Pale Morning Duns" (PMDs). The largest Drunella (grandis) is called "Green Drake", and the others are "Little Green Drakes", except often D. flavilinea (the one with the yellow stripe), which is called "Flav".  Tricos are called "Tricos".  Members of the genus Paraleptophlebia are called "Mahogany Duns" and nicknamed "Paralepts".  Siphlonurus species are called "Gray Drakes", Ephemera simulans is the "Brown Drake", and Hexagenia limbata is the "Great Michigan May", "Giant Yellow Drake", or frequently "Hex".  Rhithrogena morrisoni is the "March Brown" and Epeorus alberti is sometimes "Pink Albert".
