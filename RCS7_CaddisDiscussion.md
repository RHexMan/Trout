### Caddisflies

In some ways, fishing for caddis according to the charts is harder, and in some, easier than fishing for mayflies.  Complications and solutions are discussed in the left column of the Caddis Chart.  In addition, although the field identification of Rhyacophilidae, Glossomatidae, and Hydropsychidae, and the separation of these from the rest (the Integripalpia, or true, portable case makers) are extremely easy, identifying families in the last suborder can be difficult outside the laboratory - even the gross key features listed on the second page are not always easy to make out.  Also, Arbona's Principles often don't work very well for Integripalpia.  In particular, genera in a single family, especially those that inhabit different types of water, often have quite different looking cases (made of different materials), and eat different diets, and so have different hunting or foraging behavior.  Thus, much of the chart only works at the genus level.

On the other hand, often with caddis, fine identifications don't matter to the fishing - you just imitate what you find in the water.  This is especially true for larvae.  If you see bare, green larvae, use a lure that looks like that, if you see long round woody cases crawling along the bottom, copy that, and so forth.  Also, except for size and color, all caddis pherates look alike, especially if you believe LaFontaine when he says the pherates inflate their cuticle in order to help them rise to the film, so present to the trout as a glistening bubble with no really distinct shape and diffuse colors.  There are differences in the type of emergence (swimming, crawling, running), and you do need to know about or observe them.  The same is true of caddis adults, which again all look the same except for coloration and size.  Helpfully, differences in egg-laying behavior are easy to see.

Here is a brief summary of LaFontaine's fishing recommendations.  When nothing much is happening, say midday, trout often root, nose down, at the bottom gravel or detritus, eating anything they see or can flush out. You can best nymph at that level using high-stick or Czech technique, bouncing weighted imitations very slowly along the bottom.  Larvae in accidental (any time) or behavioral (frequently night, or early or late daytime) drift are concentrated in what LaFontaine calls the "buffer layer", the top of the boundary layer where rapidly moving free current meets water slowed and formed into eddies by bottom structure. Fish lie in the slower water, look up, and take what comes by above.  Standard long-line indicator nymphing works best there.  If the larvae rappel, color the last several inches of tippet white or brown to imitate the silk.  Pherates migrating to shore cause fish to stack up in sometimes very shallow water.  LaFontaine recommends the very slowest swing possible, letting only a sinking line tip and leader out past the rod tip, and holding the tip itself underwater so that no part of the line sees anything except boundary layer flow.  The best place to employ this technique is from the inside bar of a curve.  Fish this exposed are very skittish, so you want to be as stealthy as you can.  Pherates that have just cut themselves out of their cocoon often drift in the buffer for some time before inflating their cuticle and rising.  Long-line nymph with an indicator for them before the onset of an expected swimming emergence.  Unlike almost everyone before him, LaFontaine tells you not to bother imitating rising pherates.  They will soon get to the film and drift there, making them much easier targets for the trout, and also easy to imitate with an awash pattern, mostly dead-drifted, but occasionally twitched.  When you see a fish leap through the surface, LaFontaine's underwater observations showed that it was very rarely taking an ascender, but, rather, had been holding in the buffer and targeted an awash pherate.  Trout hold low if the current has any speed.  If it doesn't, they hold high and slurp.  If it's not moving at all, they cruise.  Fish feeding on ovipositors need to cruise, even in moving water - because the target can come down anywhere, they can't hold station the way they do for drifting pherates or expirees.  If ovipositors are smacking down from high above the water and diving, smack down your imitation.  If they are repeatedly dipping and bobbing back up, you can dap if you can get close enough, or if not, tie a bigger, somewhat sinking imitation on as your tip fly and the dipper above it in line.  With the tip fly stuck in the water as an anchor, you can occasionally lightly tension your line to pop the dipper into the air.  The fish may take either fly.  Finally, LaFontaine makes the interesting point that during oviposition, dry patterns work much better than you would think.  He believes this is because the fish are looking up for splashes, but are in no hurry since the bug is entering the water and will stay there a while.  If it happens to get stuck on the surface, that is no big deal since it can be eaten there too.  This in contrast to the situation during emergence when the bug on the surface will soon disappear.

Crib:  A relatively few caddis have traditional common names that are in wide use.  I give them here.  Many others have names that are common only locally, or worse, not common at all, but invented by authors who just couldn't stand to use the latin.  To me that seems unhelpful.  Rhyacophila larvae are called "Green Rockworms" on account of their bright green wormlike (if you don't look too closely) bodies, and the duller, olive-green adults "Green Sedges".  Sedge is an historical synonym for caddis.  Glossosoma is just "Glossosoma".  Hydropsyche is the "Spotted Sedge", reflecting the mottled patterns on the wings, and the smaller, but otherwise similar Cheumatopsyche is called the "Little Sister Sedge".  Brachycentrus species are called "Grannoms" and B. occidentalis in particular is called "Mother's Day Caddis" because of its timely emergence.  The later emerging B. americanus is the "American or Black Grannom".  Amiocentrus is the "Little Western Weedy-Water Sedge", which is a mouthful, but tells you something.  The tiny Heliopsyche are "Speckled Peters", reflecting the wing coloration pattern.  Oecetis are "Long-Horn Sedges", referring to the very long antennae of the adult (2.5x body length).  The name is confusing if you know that Oecetis is a member of the family Leptoceridae, which translates literally to "Short Horned".  This makes some sense when you remember that the antennae on most caddis larvae are nearly invisible, but you can see those in this family with the naked eye.  Mystacides are "Black Dancers".  Dicosmoecus are our huge "October Caddis" and the even bigger and more beautiful Hesperophylax is the "Silver Stripe Sedge", describing its stunningly patterned wing.
