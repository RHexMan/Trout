# Spatio-Temporal Emergence Charts

Trying to comprehend the large array of aquatic insects that make up much of a trout's diet is a daunting undertaking. However, there are a number of generalizations and commonalities that go a long way toward making the task possible.  These have been stated and exploited over the last several decades by a number of very perceptive authors.  The charts presented here give a visual summary of these organizing principles, making them memorable as a whole and accessible in detail.

The novel element in the charts is that, in addition to the usual horizontal progression of the seasons, there is, for each bug type, a vertical progression of water types, from rather sterile headwaters near the top to fertile, mature rivers below.

These particular charts include only the mayflies and caddisflies, and are somewhat localized to the waters of California and the Pacific Northwest, but with modest seasonal adjustments, keeping in mind water type, and adjusting for local species, they readily adapt to any trout waters and other bugs.

In addition to the charts themselves, there is supporting material that expands and puts into context the very condensed information on the charts.  All this comes in two forms: a zipped PDF that contains everything in one place, and a number of .md files (readable and writable in any text editor) that contain the explanitory text, and four .svg files (editable in Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator, for example) that contain the graphical charts themselves as well as the classification trees of the bugs.  The .svg files (scalable vector graphics) have the desirable property that they print perfectly at any scale.  The PDF may be downloaded from the release page for this repository (see link at the top of this page). All the other files reside in the repository itself.  They can be downloaded all at once in zipped form from the release page, or visited by pressing the "View on GitHub" button in the header to this page.
